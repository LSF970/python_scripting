# Intro to Python Scripting

## What is Scripting?

Scripting is simply a piece of code that is used to automate system oriented tasks. When you write code that carries out a practical task without needing compiling, this can be called scripting. 

Scripts are almost always written in 'high-level' langauges such as Python, Bash, Ruby among others.

## Why Python then?

Python is perfect for scripting. We have already been learning it as a programming langauge and the reasons we chose it for that are largely similar as to why we chose it for scripting:

- Easy to understand
- Many libraries
- Large community
- Language interoperability (can talk to other langauges, OS's and software)
